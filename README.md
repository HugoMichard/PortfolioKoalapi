# Welcome to PortfolioKoalapi

**Important Note**: Koalapi development has been stopped. 

Koalapi is a platform to easily build and deploy an API to share and sell your data in only a few clicks.
The API can be easily managed on the platform, is fully customizable and your customers usage and pricing plans are monitored and built directly.

The APIs currently supports three types of data: files, SQL databases, and APIs. The supported SQL databases are MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQL Server. In the future, we plan to release more types of data to allow you to provide more diverse sources to your customers.

This repository contains the landing page and part of the documentation of the project. **The app itself is currently not deployed anymore**.


# Static Landing Website

To deploy easily to github pages, you can build this project with `npm install`, then `nuxt generate` followed by `gh-pages --dotfiles -d .output/public`. This will push a branch to `gh-pages` to github. Select that branch in `Settings` > `Pages`.
